database refactor
- tests along the way. simpler types.

- how can we verify the database?
	- hash transactions?
	- autoincrementing somehow?

- build database basics, indexes, queries
- test database funtionality
- device and use identity model
- database sync

- sync databases.
- database as of transaction is an interesting pattern.
- create a query language with a permissioning model.
- live query listeners.
